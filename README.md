### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jonathan Ford (he/him) and I'm a front-end engineer from New Jersey. I love to think deeply about people, and love to combine that with my passion for code. I have several years of experience as a freelance developer and a Software Engineer Apprentice at Google, and I'm currently looking to bring my talents and passion for delighting users to the table in a UX engineering role. Find me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/jwford65)!

On the open-source side of things, I spent several years developing an open-source Discord bot named [Steve](https://github.com/stevebot-project/steve). He's a multi-purpose bot that I orginally developed for a single server, but later refactored to be able to be used in any server.
