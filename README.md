### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jonathan Ford (he/him), and I'm from New Jersey, USA. I'm a Front End Node.js Developer currently focused on projects using TypeScript and React. You might know me from [Steve](https://github.com/tuataria/steve), a Discord bot I helped to create originally for the [Tuataria](https://tuataria.com) server. I'm currently working on a contract basis as a Technical Manager for [Life's Library Book Club](https://lifeslibrarybookclub.com). 

I'm currently working my way through courses in Boostrap and React/React Native to increase my knowledge and profiency in web technologies.
