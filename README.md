### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jonathan Ford (he/him), and I'm from New Jersey, USA. I'm an aspring UX Engineer currently focused on Discord bots and other TypeScript projects. You might know me from [Steve](https://github.com/tuataria/steve), a Discord bot I helped to create originally for the [Tuataria](https://tuataria.com) server.

I'm currently working my way through courses in Boostrap and React/React Native to increase my knowledge and profiency in web technologies.
